title: About me
---

My name is Alberto Soragna.
I am a Senior Robotics Software Engineer at iRobot and this is my personal website.

My main research interest is mobile robotics, in particular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and autonomous navigation strategies.
I have a not-so-secret passion for software development and in my free time I enjoy learning about new tools and expanding my programming skills.
I love to travel and basketball.  

I believe in the importance of open-source software. Have a look at my [Projects section](/projects) for some highlights or at my [Github page](https://github.com/alsora) for more information.
If you want to contact me with respect to any of my pojects, the simplest way is to open an issue on its Github page.

## Studies Background

I received a **B.Sc. in Automation Engineering** from *Alma Mater Studiorum* University of Bologna (Italy). Besides building a solid background in Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science, I studied Control Architectures, Control System Technologies and Electric Drives.
I was one of the winners of the Almatong scholarship, which allowed me to spend the whole second year studying Automation Engineering at the *Tongji University* of Shanghai (China).
My interest in robotics started with my B.Sc. thesis carried out at the Center for Research on Complex Automated Systems (CASY) laboratory of the University of Bologna, where I worked under the supervision of its director Prof. Lorenzo Marconi.
I worked on the design and the implementation of a kinematic control architecture for a quadrotor aerial vehicle as part of the SHERPA project of the European Research Council.  

I took a **M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Engineering** at *La Sapienza* University of Rome (Italy).
Throughout the different courses, I broaded my knowledge of a wide variety of fields such as Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Mobile and Industrial Robotics, while also developing proficiency in computer science and probability theory.
I was admitted to the University's Excellence Path, reserved to the more high performing students enrolled in the whole department, which granted me a scholarship and allowed me to take part in the research activities of the Robust Robotics laboratory directed by Prof. Giorgio Grisetti. Here I developed a novel exploration strategy for robots equipped with LIDAR and I tested the implementation on a wheeled mobile platform.
For my M.Sc. thesis I did an internship at *Kuka Robotics* in Augsbugs (Germany).
I was a member of the Mobile Robotics Navigation team in the R&D department, under the supervision of Dr. Rainer Kummerle.
During this time I designed and implemented a complete active SLAM strategy capable of exploiting prior information in the form of connectivity graphs.

From this work we produced two patents and a conference paper, for all of which I am first author.
The [Publications section](/publications) contains an up-to-date list of my research contributions.

## Professional Experience

I worked as **Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer** at *Musixmatch* in Bologna (Italy). As part of my role I had to maintain and develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for the extraction of structural information and deep metadata from text. This was applied to company's song lyrics database, the biggest in the world.
I designed and implemented several new functionalities, taking care of all the different phases: from features engineering, to training and validation, fine tuning and deployment in production. Some of my most successful accomplishments have been from the use of ensembles, i.e. mixing rule-based approaches with machine learning and deep learning techniques.
During this period I have been invited from the University of Bologna to give a lecture on probabilistic and machine learning-based NLP algorithms.

I am currently working at *iRobot* where I started as **Robotics & Vision Engineer** and successively got promoted to **Senior Software Robotics Engineer**.
