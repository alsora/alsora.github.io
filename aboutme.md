title: About me
---

My name is Alberto Soragna.
I'm a Senior Robotics Software Engineer at iRobot and this is my personal website.

My main research interest is mobile robotics, in particular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and autonomous navigation strategies.
I have a not-so-secret passion for software sevelopment and in my free time I enjoy learning new tools and enlarging my programming skills.
I love to travel and play Basketball.  

I believe in open-source software. Have a look at my [projects section](/projects) for some highlights or at my [Github page](https://github.com/alsora).
If you want to contact me with respect to one of these pojects, please open an issue on its Github page.

## Studies Background

I took my **Bachelor of Science in Automation Engineering** at *Alma Mater Studiorum* University of Bologna (Italy). I had the opportunity to build a solid background in Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science, while also studying Control Architectures, Control System Technologies and Electric Drives.
I was one of the winners of the Almatong scholarship, which allowed me to spend the whole second year studying at the *Tongji University* of Shanghai (China).
My interest in robotics started with my B.Sc. thesis carried out at the Center for Research on Complex Automated Systems (CASY) laboratory of the University.
I worked on the design and the implementation of a kinematic control architecture for a quadrotoer aerial vehicle as part of the SHERPA project of the European Research Council.  

I have a **Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Engineering** from *La Sapienza* University of Rome (Italy).
Across the different classes, I dived into many different fields such as Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Mobile and Industrial Robotics, while also developing a relevant knowledge in statistics and probability.
I was admitted to the University's Excellence Path, reserved to the more high performing students enrolled in the department, which allowed me to take part for 6 months to the research activities of the Robust Robotics laboratory directed by Prof. Giorgio Grisetti. Here I had the opportunity of working on novel exploration strategies for LIDAR based mobile robots.

For my M.Sc. thesis I worked at *Kuka Robotics* in Augsbugs (Germany) for 6 months.
I was a member of the Mobile Robotics Navigation team in the R&D department, under the direct supervision of Dr. Rainer Kummerle.
During this time I designed and implemented an active SLAM system capable of exploiting prior information in the form of connectivity graphs.
From this framework we also produced two patents and an IROS conference paper, for all of which I am first author.

## Professional Experience

I worked as **Data Scientis and Machine Learning Engineer** at *Musixmatch* in Bologna (Italy). My job consisted in designing and implementing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for song lyrics with the purpose of extracting structural information and deep metadata.

During this period I have been invited from the University of Bologna to give a  lecture on classic and modern NLP algorithms.

I started working at *iRobot* in August 2018 as Robotics & Vision Engineer.
In 2020 I got promoted to **Senior Software Robotics Engineer**.
