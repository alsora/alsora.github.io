title: About me
---

My name is Alberto Soragna.
I am a Senior Robotics Software Engineer at iRobot and this is my personal website.

My main research interest is mobile robotics, in particular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and autonomous navigation strategies.
I have a not-so-secret passion for software development and in my free time I enjoy learning new tools and expanding my programming skills.
I love to travel and play basketball.  

I believe in open-source software. Have a look at my [projects section](/projects) for some highlights or at my [Github page](https://github.com/alsora).
If you want to contact me with respect to one of these pojects, please open an issue on its Github page.

## Studies Background

I took my **Bachelor of Science in Automation Engineering** at *Alma Mater Studiorum* University of Bologna (Italy). Besides building a solid background in Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science, I studied Control Architectures, Control System Technologies and Electric Drives.
I was one of the winners of the Almatong scholarship, which allowed me to spend the whole second year studying at the *Tongji University* of Shanghai (China).
My interest in robotics started with my B.Sc. thesis carried out at the Center for Research on Complex Automated Systems (CASY) laboratory of the University, directed by Prof. Lorenzo Marconi.
I worked on the design and the implementation of a kinematic control architecture for a quadrotor aerial vehicle as part of the SHERPA project of the European Research Council.  

I have a **Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Engineering** from *La Sapienza* University of Rome (Italy).
Across the different classes, I dived into a wide variety of fields such as Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Mobile and Industrial Robotics, while also developing practical knowledge in statistics and probability.
I was admitted to the University's Excellence Path, reserved to the more high performing students enrolled in the department, which allowed me to take part in the research activities of the Robust Robotics laboratory directed by Prof. Giorgio Grisetti. Here I investigated novel exploration strategies for robots equipped with LIDAR and I implemented them on a wheeled mobile platform.
For my M.Sc. thesis I worked at *Kuka Robotics* in Augsbugs (Germany).
I was a member of the Mobile Robotics Navigation team in the R&D department, under the supervision of Dr. Rainer Kummerle.
During this time I designed and implemented an active SLAM framework capable of exploiting prior information in the form of connectivity graphs.
From this work we produced two patents and a conference paper, for all of which I am first author.

## Professional Experience

I worked as **Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer** at *Musixmatch* in Bologna (Italy). As part of my role I had to maintain and expand a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for processing song lyrics with the purpose of extracting structural information and deep metadata.
I designed and deployed in production several new components, taking care of all the different phases as features engineering, training and validation, and fine tuning. Some of my most successful accomplishments have been from the use of ensembles, i.e. mixing rule-based approaches with machine learning and deep learning techniques.
During this period I have been invited from the University of Bologna to give a  lecture on classic and modern NLP algorithms.

I am currently working at *iRobot* where I started as **Robotics & Vision Engineer** and successively got promoted to **Senior Software Robotics Engineer**.
